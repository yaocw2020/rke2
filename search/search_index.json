We are choosing to place our ADRs in a version control system where the history of the decision can be queried in the versions of the document itself.  This is handy because it lowers the total number of docs that will accumulate and allows us to give the files contextual names. Our file names can summarize the decision they contain so that readers can easily find and reference that decision.</p>"},{"location":"adrs/#status-types","title":"Status Types","text":"<p>Michael gives four potential statuses for an ADR: \"proposed\", \"accepted\", \"deprecated\", and \"superseded\".

Changes which are in review are handled in PRs, the review is finalized after a period of time with the status of \"accepted\" or \"rejected\". If a decision supersedes another we change the superseded decision's status to \"superseded by <code>doc</code>\" where the doc is a link to the decision which superseded it.
